Have you ever tried looking for some basic but something special in it? Then here is the perfect solution for you. Low classic has been operated by Myeongshin Lee based in Seoul since 2009. This brand is well-known to express feminine beauty as well as a classic silhouette. Moreover, every outfit has a special detail such as a slit or mixing each of the different fabrics. Especially, Myeongshin Lee who is the representative of Low classic had mentioned that she mostly has been getting inspired by Seoul's atmosphere. For this reason, when you see her show, you would be able to recognize Seoul’s typical modern color as well as feel the aesthetic aspect in every her show.

In 2019 F/W collection, we would saw classic and modern yet comfy garments in that show. Also, as I mentioned above, there was diverse details kind of using a utility of fabrics (a geometric design printing on the fabric was also so matching with the clothes)with a basic one or the detail which is bottom slit either pants and dresses. This detail of the slit not only looked more pointable but also made comfortable. Such combination made elevate the quality of the collection and even looked more stand out in the middle of other brands that have the same mood.
