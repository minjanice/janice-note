# Welcome!

####  “To all the people who have adored Korea” 

Hi, welcome to Janice Note! I’m so glad you stopped by!

I hope this blog will be able to help you to find a good place or a brand that you interest in Korea. 

Working in the fashion industry as a designer, I’ve been getting inspiration from other places especially cafe as well as Korea fashion brands. Luckily, I could have learned and got motivation from not only artistic places but Korea brands. For this reason, I hope you will have a delightful memory in Korea through a story sharing about the place I have been to as a Korean in Seoul (sometimes giving information about Korean regions).

#### You can’t go wrong with Janice Note!

I’m an enthusiast of coffee as well as fashion. I’ve got numerous things to share the place where I’ve been visiting. Also, I can’t wait to inform you about a fashion brand which is rising stars in Korea. Let’s have fun with me in Korea and share a bunch of stories with other people who want to join us.
