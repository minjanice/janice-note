&lt;p&gt;Hi, welcome to Janice Note! I’m so glad you stopped by!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this blog will be able to help you to find a good place or a brand that you interest in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in the fashion industry as a designer, I’ve been getting inspiration from other places especially cafe as well as Korea fashion brands. Luckily, I could have learned and got motivation from not only artistic places but Korea brands. For this reason, I hope you will have a delightful memory in Korea through a story sharing about the place I have been to as a Korean in Seoul (sometimes giving information about Korean regions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-cant-go-wrong-with-janice-note&quot;&gt;You can’t go wrong with Janice Note!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an enthusiast of coffee as well as fashion. I’ve got numerous things to share the place where I’ve been visiting. Also, I can’t wait to inform you about a fashion brand which is rising stars in Korea. Let’s have fun with me in Korea and share a bunch of stories with other people who want to join us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Janice Cho</name></author><category term="cafe" /><category term="fashion" /><category term="coffee" /><category term="lifestyle" /><category term="Korea" /><summary type="html">Welcome!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22thumb-main.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22feature%22=%3E%22thumb-main.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
