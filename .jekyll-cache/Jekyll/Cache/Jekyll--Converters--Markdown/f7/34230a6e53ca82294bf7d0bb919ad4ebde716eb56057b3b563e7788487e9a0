<p>Cafe Halff Coffee, located at Seoulâ€™s express terminal, is a popular cafe not only for buttery cream lattes but also for other cream lattes (i.e., matcha and banana flavor of cream). These cream coffee have got a luscious and deep taste, especially the cream which is top of the coffee texture has a little thickness is the point of this coffee. One tip to give you when you sip your coffee is that you shouldnâ€™t stir it all because of the taste. You see, this coffee has layered, you would feel the different tastes in each layer. Make sure this tip if you want to drink harmonized taste.</p>

<p>Even though the coffee price is not affordable (when I saw the price, I thought that was evil ðŸ‘¿), but it is worth to try if youâ€™re a traveler or you living far from Express Terminal station.</p>

<p>Besides, Cafe Halff Coffee is famous for its cream latte, as well as for its interior.</p>

<p>The place is quite narrow compared to other cafes, but because of the colorful aesthetic mood and cozy atmosphere, you can take selfies with your friends or leave memories of your trip. But one thing I didnâ€™t like was that it was uncomfortable for me to sit down and chat. In my opinion, perhaps taking coffee out and drinking it can be savored much more perfectly.</p>
