<p>Hi, welcome to Janice Note! I‚Äôm so glad you stopped by!</p>

<p>I hope this blog will be able to help you to find a good place or a brand that you interest in Korea.</p>

<p>Working in the fashion industry as a designer, I‚Äôve been getting inspiration from other places especially cafe as well as Korea fashion brands. Luckily, I could have learned and got motivation from not only artistic places but Korea brands. For this reason, I hope you will have a delightful memory in Korea through a story sharing about the place I have been to as a Korean in Seoul (sometimes giving information about Korean regions).</p>

<p>I‚Äôm an enthusiast of coffee as well as fashion. I‚Äôve got numerous things to share the place where I‚Äôve been visiting. Also, I can‚Äôt wait to inform you about a fashion brand which is rising stars in Korea. Let‚Äôs have fun with me in Korea and share a bunch of stories with other people who want to join us.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
