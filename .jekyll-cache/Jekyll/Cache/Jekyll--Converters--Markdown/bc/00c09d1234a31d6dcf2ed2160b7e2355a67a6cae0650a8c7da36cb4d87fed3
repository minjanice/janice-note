<p>Did you ever hear about EASTLOGUE? Well, if you found this brand for the first time in your life, you should know this brand cos this label has been widely known globally since 2011. EASTLOGUE is based in Seoul, the Republic of Korea. This brand has a very unique detail such as plenty of pockets with different sizes as well as designs on an outfit, even mix-matched fabrics combined with refined garments are worthy of attention.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a lot of pockets are one of the features of this brand. Whenever we saw this point, we knew that is EASTLOGUE without a doubt, even though they collaborate with other brands. FYI, they have worked with New Balance in September 2019, and the project title was “RIGGER MADE” which was based on a special military uniform made by a rigger for the Sky Army during World War II. In this project, we can see that many pockets have signatures of EASTLOGUE that visually communicated the theme. Furthermore, Polartec and Gore-Tex lining have also enhanced the aspect of utility. In this work, although the logo of New Balance stood out in place of EASTLOGUE, we could see that EASTLOGUE was involved in this collaboration.</p>

<p>The buckle that I mentioned above, they unveiled different type of buckle last season. I have already caught the brand has been preferably using a buckle or a button a lot than a zipper. But this buckle has easy access and makes more aesthetic as well. In this case, this type has got two killed birds with one stone. The design of the buckle is not only so matching naturally with their special workwear form of jacket but function, so you don’t need to struggle when you zipped up an outer. We already know how annoying it is when a zipper gets stuck in clothes!</p>

<p>However, if you are looking for a timeless and simple one, you can easily find that ideal type of wood button in this brand which makes the style much classical and perfect to match with its low chroma colors. Trust me, a wood button can be changing the mood even if it’s a dull puffer jacket.</p>

<h4 id="2019-extra-service-collection">2019 EXTRA SERVICE Collection</h4>

<p>What about the well-matched fabrics? To cap off the year, 2019 F/W Extra Service collection unveiled. This collection has proved that the combination is a masterpiece and well-designed as well. The clever thing was each of the fabric characters was different, but the color was almost the same chroma. The combination of materials does not compromise the classical mood with its refined and monotonous colors, as it poses a potential danger.</p>
