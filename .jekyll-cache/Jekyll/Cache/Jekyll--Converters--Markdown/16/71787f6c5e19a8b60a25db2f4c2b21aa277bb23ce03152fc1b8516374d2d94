<h4 id="hey-i-am-in-hong-kong">Hey, I am in Hong Kong!</h4>

<p>If you’re a coffee lover or a milk tea geek, here is a fantastic place for you. This cafe I found a couple of days ago, which was looking extraordinary. Besides, this cafe is a rising place recently at sungshin university in seoul. When I saw it at first, I thought that it must be interiors like a characteristic night light atmosphere, cos the sign had a neon sign which was green colored as like hong kong’s town at night. However, this cafe was against my expectations when I entered the place. The wall inside has covered with bath tiles and somehow those tiles suggested an old fashioned bath of korea(even when I followed up upstairs with the banister, it made me felt more like i’m in a bathroom!). But when I looked at the 2nd floor, i changed my mind completely.</p>

<p>The interior was cozy rather than I thought. I felt like I was in the moment of the movie called chungking express. Moreover, the stand light furniture was on point with the tile interior as well as the well-designed broken wall. It led me into the mood kind of a little house in hong kong.</p>

<p>Do you want a delight relish drink instead of coffee?  Or if you are the person who has a difficult to choose every moment or suffer from caffeine-related disorders? Then you have got an answer to take milk tea in korea. FYI, most of the milk tea in korea has normally a good quality of taste. and for sure, I would have to say milk tea is probably the best choice in this cafe as well. At this moment, i think you have a question about why I recommend this common tea for now? Of course, you can drink tea everywhere even if not in this cafe. But I want to say why I suggest you this milk tea is exceptional in every particular. Honestly, I don’t have a penchant for strong taste when it comes to tea things. In my case, if the tea has a strong flavor, it amplifies the bitter taste even more. In this respect, it is perfect for me and someone like me. This tea is so mild and light, but the flavor had vividly lingered in my mouth. Not for wild but so luscious. Even though it looks so simple, trust me, the taste might lead you gently into the heaven of tea!</p>

<p>Oh, BTW, i just wanted you to know that the pineapple buns have been coming out at noon. Back then, I had no idea about the bread has been making in this cafe and even the time that they put out! So please make sure if you want to try fresh bread, you need to visit this place at the right hour as well.</p>

<p>When you visit the place after see my blog later, please tell us in the comments below about your idea of how the bread was or what else.</p>
