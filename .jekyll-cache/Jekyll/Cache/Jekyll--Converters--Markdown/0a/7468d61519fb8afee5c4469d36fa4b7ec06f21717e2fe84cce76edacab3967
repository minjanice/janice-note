<h4 id="cafe-onion">Cafe Onion</h4>

<p>Back in the day, Seongsu was well-known for factory complexes like steel, shoe-making or something else. However, in these days, Seongsu is no longer than the factory industry at all, rather become a hippest area. At this point, Cafe Onion might be the best place to show people why this area earned a reputation for being the hottest district of a cafe in Korea.</p>

<p>This cafe was reborn as an extraordinary space where the past and present coexist because it designed and renewed as little as possible. And bread, as well as coffee, has become another attractive point that coffee geeksâ€™ go-to place. For this reason, Cafe Onion has made popular of itself.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, If when you come to this place, a diverse type and flavor of bread would be able to catch your eyes at first. Furthermore, Cafe Onion serves up bread from Bread 05 Bakery, so you can get a freshly baked bread in-house.</p>

<p>Of all this bread, if you want to know which bread by far the best in this cafe, I would say Pandora bread cos this is a popular choice compared with others. For your information, Pandora is Italian-style bread covered with powdered sugar. (But the tricky thing is that when you try to eat this bread, powdered sugar can be sprayed around you.)</p>
